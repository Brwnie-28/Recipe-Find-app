1. RecipeFind Web application:
A web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. The app can provide recipe suggestions and even generate a shopping list.

2. Team Members:
As I am working alone on this project,I will be responsible for all roles including project management, development, testing, and deployment.

3. Technologies:
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Other: Git for version control, Heroku for deployment

4. Trade-offs:
MongoDB vs SQL: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility and scalability. SQL could have been used but it requires a predefined schema and is less scalable.
Node.js vs Python: Node.js was chosen for its efficiency and speed in handling asynchronous requests. Python could have been used but Node.js performs better in this scenario.

5. Challenge Statement:
Problem: Users often have ingredients but don't know what to cook. The Recipe Finder is intended to solve this problem by providing recipes based on the ingredients users have.
The Recipe Finder will not solve the problem of cooking the meal itself.
The Recipe Finder will help anyone who enjoys cooking and is looking for new recipe ideas. The users will be home cooks and food enthusiasts.
This project is not dependent on a specific locale.

6. Risks:
Technical Risks: One risk is the potential unavailability or unreliability of a recipe API. The safeguard for this is to have a backup API or a local database of recipes.
Non-Technical Risks: One risk is time management. To mitigate this, a detailed project plan will be followed and progress will be tracked regularly.

7. Infrastructure:
Branching and Merging: The GitHub flow will be used for branching and merging.
Deployment: The application will be deployed on Heroku.
Data: The application will use a recipe API to populate the app with data.
Testing: Unit tests will be written using Jest. Manual testing will also be performed.

8. Existing Solutions:
Similar Products: AllRecipes, Food Network Kitchen, Tasty
AllRecipes and Food Network Kitchen provide recipes but do not allow users to search by ingredients. Tasty allows users to search by ingredients but does not have the option to save favorite recipes. The Recipe Finder will combine these features, allowing users to search by ingredients and save their favorite recipes.
